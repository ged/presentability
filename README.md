## Description

Facade-based presenters with minimal assumptions. This library contains
utilities for setting up presenters for data classes for things like web
services, logging output, etc.

It is intended to be dead-simple by default, returning a Hash containing
only the attributes you have intentionally exposed from the subject.

The most basic usage looks something like this:

    require 'presentatbility'

    # lib/acme/presenters.rb
    module Acme::Presenters
      extend Presentability
      
      presenter_for Acme::Widget do
        expose :sku
        expose :name
        expose :unit_price
      end
    end

    # lib/acme/service.rb
    class Acme::Service < Some::Webservice::Framework
    
      get '/api/widgets/<sku>' do |sku|
        widget = Acme::Widget.lookup( sku )
        content_type 'application/json'
        representation = Acme::Presenters.present( widget )
        return representation.to_json
      end
    
    end

Note that Presentability doesn't do any encoding for you, or infer anything, or
require that you alter your data classes. It's just a collection of Facades for
your data objects that return a limited representation of their subjects.

More details can be found in the docs for the Presentability module, and in
Presentability::Presenter.

See GettingStarted to get started with your own presenters.
